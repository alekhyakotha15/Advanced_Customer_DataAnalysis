# Advanced Customer Data Analysis Using SQL

## Overview

This Advanced Sales Analysis Project showcases my expertise in SQL by analyzing three key datasets: Customers, Products, and Sales. Through in-depth data exploration and advanced querying techniques, I addressed critical business questions related to sales performance, customer trends, and changes over time. By leveraging SQL functions, joins, window functions, and aggregate calculations, I extracted actionable insights that help understand sales growth, customer segments. This project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can enhance business strategies and optimize revenue generation.

##Objectives

- Finding the top selling and least selling products by their sales (Top 5, Last 5).
- Segmenting customers according to their spending (VIP, Regular, New).
- Change over time analysis to find revenue over time.
- Analyzing the yearly performance of products to previous year sales.
- Calculating the total sales per month and the running total of sales over time.
- Finding which categories of products contribute the most to overall sales.
- Generating Customer, Product reports which contain all important details, segments and kpis.

Also I have performed Data, Date, Measures, Dimensions explorations using SQL in order to answer some basic business questions like Total Sales, Average Sales, No.of Products, No.of Orders, No.of Customers and also to find Unique Orders, Date of First and Last Order, Youngest and Oldest Customer and also information related to Countries and Product Line.
